## Given:
- <TeX formula={'3n+1'} /> players in a gossip commons
- <TeX formula={'{v_0, v_1, ... v_{3n+1}}'}/> secret values in set <TeX formula={'M'}/>
- <TeX formula={'i'}/>th player only knows <TeX formula={'v_i'}/>
- a very powerful malicious agent (the Adversary)

```notes
M is some message space, like a binary string of some length
```

---
export default Layout

## Accomplish this:
- by known time t, each player reach a decision
- <div />each player's decision is in <TeX formula={'M \\cup \\bot '}/>
- no two players disagree on their decision
- <div />if <TeX formula={'v_i = V'}/> for all <TeX formula={'i'}/>, then every player has decided on <TeX formula={'V'}/>.

# How can this be done?

---
export default Layout

## Devise a game:
- all players will play faithfully
- game will consist of rounds
- all players will eventually halt
- all players reach a Decision

---
export default Layout

# This is easy in 1 round:

<div /> Each player <TeX formula={'i'}/> gossips <TeX formula={'v_i'}/>.

<div /> If she ever receives a gossiped message that is not <TeX formula={'v_i'}/>, she decides on <TeX formula={'\\bot'}/>.

<div /> If not, then when round 1 ends, decide on <TeX formula={'v_i'}/>.

# That was too easy, wasn't it?

yes.

don't forget: this must not only be true but Provably so

## Because of our Adversary:

remember, ze is very powerful!

... how powerful, exactly?

---
export default Layout

## Ze can:

- instantaneously corrupt players by name
- control the actions of corrupted players
- perfectly coordinate all corrupt behavior
- adapt hir corruption choices between rounds
- control the message passing network

```notes
so, in our lighthearted game, ze can trivially force all decisions to be \\bot.
```

# ü§Ø

```notes
we should just fall down and die, right?
```

---
export default Layout

## Ze cannot, within one round:
- leverage unbounded compute power
- prevent a true message from propagating
- corrupt more than `n` players (honest majority)

```notes
point out that "round" is kinda like a quantum of time

so, for example, writing down the private keys and using them in a later round still
counts as corrupting that user in a later round

emphasize: this is FAR MORE POWERFUL than the adversarial model in bitcoin, stellar
this is also not a totally precise specification but suffices for this talk
```

# only require resolutions among consistently honest majority

---
export default Layout

## An honest majority should consistently resolve:
- by known time t, each player reach a decision
- <div />each player's decision is in <TeX formula={'M \\cup \\bot '}/>
- no two players disagree on their decision
- <div />if <TeX formula={'v_i = V'}/> for all <TeX formula={'i'}/>, then every player has decided on <TeX formula={'V'}/>.

- corrupt players do whatever adversary want
- game will consist of rounds

# 1: a graded consensus protocol

## Graded consensus:

All players `i` in an honest majority will halt with a transformation like:

<TeX formula={"v'_i \\rightarrow (v_i, g_i)"}/>

```notes
though, in reality, we generally define Graded Consensus for any proportion of honesty, and only solve it for t >= 3n + 1
```

- <div /> <TeX formula={"v'_i"} /> is an initial value known only to <TeX formula={'i'} />
- <div /> all honest with <TeX formula={'g > 0'}/> chose same <TeX formula={'v_i'} />
- <div /> honestly chosen <TeX formula={'g'}/> never include both <TeX formula={'0'}/> and <TeX formula={'2'}/>
- <div /> unanimous honest <TeX formula={"v'_i"}/> imply all <TeX formula={'(v_i, g_i) = (V, 2)'}/>

## binary BA:

All players `i` in an honest majority will halt with a transformation like:

<TeX formula={"b'_i \\rightarrow b_i"}/>

---
export default Layout

<TeX formula={"b'_i \\rightarrow b_i"}/>

- <div /> all <TeX formula={"b'_i, b_i \\in \\{0,1\\}"} />
- <TeX formula={"b'_i"}/> is an initial bit known only to i
- all honest `i` decide on same result (agreement)
- <div/>unanimous honest <TeX formula={"b'_i"}/> will not flip their bits (consistency)

# 3: a sortition scheme

- <TeX formula={"t < r \\rightarrow \\forall \\Sigma: P\[CONFIRM_p(\\Sigma_{i}(r))\] \\approx 0"} />

# Choosing the initial `v'` for all honest players

export default Layout

## Ok, so each round choose `v'` like so:
1. every player computes a lotto ticket ùùà
2. if they believe it wins, propagate it
3. everyone chooses the best ùùà winner as `v'`

# What about the bad case

the adversary cannot prevent a true winner from propagating their ticket ... but ze will have a true winning ticket hirself in `n/3n+1` cases and CAN elect to send hir true winning ticket only to subset of players:

### This case reduces to honest propagation, because ze still has control over block proposal.

### Consequence:

## The adversary can force 1/3 of blocks to omit transactions, and make agreement take maximum allowed time.

---
export default Layout

remember, transactions cannot be forged, so the risk we are confronting is that state changes are prevented..

Probability that a requested transaction can be withheld by the adversary for 1 hour:

<TeX formula={"P \\approx 1/3.5 \\times 10^9"} />

```notes
leader election's purpose is to ensure there's an agreed upon ledger order: everyone already has a decently saturated set of transactions.

1 hour is a standard minimum waiting period for bitcoins to clear.
Here, it is a pessimistic maximum.

# Player Replaceability

This is a novel property.

---
export default Layout

The adversary is mobile. Once the protocol begins, why doesn't ze just corrupt all the committee members?

---
export default Layout

The committee is re-randomized in every step, and each step consists of only 1 message being sent by each member, revealing decision and identity simultanelously.

Once that message is propagated, ze cannot stop it, and ze gains no benefit from maintaining corruption of that user, whose job is done.

---
export default Layout

Thus, in a player-replaceable byzantine agreement, even a mobile adversary who must corrupt players by name cannot capture a committee majority in a single step except with negligible probability.
