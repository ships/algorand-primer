# byzantine agreement in ALGORAND

---

## Given:
- 3n + 1 players in a gossip commons
- {v_0, v_1, ... v_{3n+1}} secret values in Z
- each player `i` only knows `v_i`
- a powerful malicious agent (the Adversary)

---

## Accomplish this:
- by known time t, each player reach a decision
- each player's decision is in `{Z ⋃ ⊥ }`
- no two players disagree on their decision
- if `v_i = V` for all `i`, then every player has decided on `V`.

---

# How can this be done?

---

## Devise a game:
- all players will play faithfully
- game will consist of rounds
- all players will eventually halt
- all players reach a Decision

---

# This is easy in 1 round:
Each player `i` gossips `v_i`.

If she ever receives a gossiped message that is not `v_i`, she decides on `⊥`.

If not, then when round 1 ends, decide on `v_i`.

---

# That was too easy, wasn't it?

yes.

```notes
don't forget: this must not only be true but Provably so
```

---

## Because of our Adversary:

remember, ze is very powerful!

... how powerful, exactly?

---

## Ze can:

- instantaneously corrupt players by name
- control the actions of corrupted players
- perfectly coordinate all corrupt behavior
- adapt hir corruption choices between rounds
- control the message passing network

```notes
so, in our lighthearted game, ze can trivially force all decisions to be ⊥.
```

---

# 🤯

```notes
we should just fall down and die, right?
```

---

## Ze cannot, within one round:
- leverage unbounded compute power
- prevent a true message from propagating
- corrupt more than `n` players (honest majority)

```notes
point out that "round" is kinda like a quantum of time

so, for example, writing down the private keys and using them in a later round still
counts as corrupting that user in a later round

emphasize: this is FAR MORE POWERFUL than the adversarial model in bitcoin, stellar
this is also not a totally precise specification but suffices for this talk
```
---

# How can this be done?

---

## Devise a game:
- all honest players will play faithfully
- corrupt players do whatever adversary want
- game will consist of rounds
- honest players will eventually halt
- honest players reach a Decision in `{Z ⋃ ⊥ }`

# 1: a graded consensus protocol

---

## Graded consensus:

All players `i` in an honest majority will halt with a transformation like:

### `v'_i → (v_i, g_i)`

```notes
though, in reality, we generally define Graded Consensus for any proportion of honesty, and only solve it for t >= 3n + 1
```

---

### `v'_i → (v_i, g_i)`

- `∀i : {v'_i, v_i} ⊂ Z, {g_i} ⊂ {0,1,2}`
- v'_i is an initial value known only to `i`
- all honest with `g > 0` chose same `v_i`
- honestly chosen `g` never include both `0` and `2`
- if all honest `v'_i` are the same value `V`, then all `(v_i, g_i) = (V, 2)`

# 2: a binary byzantine agreement protocol
---

## binary BA:

All players `i` in an honest majority will halt with a transformation like:

### `b'_i → b_i`

---

### `b'_i → b_i`

- `∀i : {b_i, b'_i} ⊂ {0,1}`
- b'_i is an initial bit known only to `i`
- all honest `i` decide on same result (agreement)
- if all honest `b'_i` are the same value `B`, then all `b_i = B` (consistency)

# Composition is straightforward

---

# Choosing the initial `v'` for all honest players

What if a player could reliably prove to everyone that they had won a fair, robust, and random lotto?

```
∀i,p,q ∈ N; r ∈ Z:
CONFIRM_p(𝝈_i(r)) = CONFIRM_q(𝝈_i(r))
P[CONFIRM_p(𝝈_i(r))] = 1/N

t < r → ∀Σ: P[CONFIRM_p(Σ_i(r))] ≈ 0
```
```notes
for any function Big-Sigma which can be computed before round r begins
```

---

## Ok, so each round choose `v'` like so:
1. every player computes a lotto ticket 𝝈
2. if they believe it wins, propagate it
3. everyone chooses the best 𝝈 winner as `v'`

---

# What about the bad case

the adversary cannot prevent a true winner from propagating their ticket ... but ze will have a true winning ticket hirself in `n/3n+1` cases and CAN elect to send hir true winning ticket only to subset of players:

---

[ drawing of this case ]

---

### This case reduces to honest propagation, because ze still has control over block proposal.

### Consequence:

## The adversary can force 1/3 of blocks to omit transactions, and make agreement take maximum allowed time.

---

remember, transactions cannot be forged, so the risk we are confronting is that state changes are prevented..

Probability that a requested transaction can be withheld by the adversary for 1 hour:

P ≈ 1/3.5B

```notes
leader election's purpose is to ensure there's an agreed upon ledger order: everyone already has a decently saturated set of transactions.

1 hour is a standard minimum waiting period for bitcoins to clear.
Here, it is a pessimistic maximum.
```

---

# How does this scale?

[ 10B ] [ 4K ] [ 1 ]

---

# Player Replaceability

This is a novel property.

---

The adversary is mobile. Once the protocol begins, why doesn't ze just corrupt all the committee members?

---

The committee is re-randomized in every step, and each step consists of only 1 message being sent by each member, revealing decision and identity simultanelously.

Once that message is propagated, ze cannot stop it, and ze gains no benefit from maintaining corruption of that user, whose job is done.

---

Thus, in a player-replaceable byzantine agreement, even a mobile adversary who must corrupt players by name cannot capture a committee majority in a single step except with negligible probability.
