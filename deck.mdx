# my favorite byzantine agreement system
<br/>
â€  to date <br/>
â€ â€  with one major flaw


```notes
the major flaw i'll share at the end
but first...
```

---
export default Layout

Why is it my favorite?

- Most explicit adversarial model
- Very resilient (player replaceability)
- Innovative, intuitive, fast
- Much stronger proofs than most whitepapers

```notes
writing style, theory approach very appealing
```

We want to **keep**:

- leader and verifier committee random election
- block finality when round ends
- energy efficiency, etc

---
export default Layout

But we want to fix:

- democoin's `v(t)` is implausible to implement
- democoin can be defeated by a Sybil
- democoin can be defeated by a simple mobile adversary

---
export default Layout

# Sybil attack

Adversary creates numerous dummy players with no money, to dilute lottery power of honest players

Resisted when your lottery power scales with currency holdings

```notes
this resists because you must overtake the whole network by outside means to accomplish it
```

---

# what is a mobile adversary?

ze can corrupt different players each round!

---
export default Split

<div>

### Democoin safe if ze:

```
- chooses up to n players out of 3n+1
- once a player is corrupted, they remain corrupted forever
- corrupt players are chosen in advance of play
```

</div>

<div>

### Algorand safe if ze:

```
- chooses up to n "shares" in any given step (weighted by currency holdings)
- a player remains corrupted only for 1 step
- can make hir choices progressively during the step
- corruption can be done instantaneously
- can read any sent message first
- can reorder message delivering during a step
- cannot prevent messages from being delivered
```

</div>

# Cryptographic Sortition

Players are selected randomly, unpredictably, and verifiably for both leadership and committee membership

---
export default Layout

Democoin: the common unpredictable random `v(t)` is combined with user identity to determine their leader/committee status for block at time `t`

---
export default Layout

Algorand: each block contains a random value Q which each user signs to determine status in following block

---

<BgImage src={require("file-loader!./assets/q-chained.jpg")} />

---
export default Layout

If Q values are chained, how do we prevent early computation?

---
export default Layout

This requires a new primitive:

# Verifiable Random Functions

---
export default Layout

# VRF schemes consist of 3 functions:

Keygen - Sign - Verify

---
export default Layout

but must have this special property:

# a signature must be indistinguishable from random string

---
export default Layout

now, leader can submit `VRF_SIGN(Q)` to be the next Q in the block proposal

---

<BgImage src={require("file-loader!./assets/q-sig-chained.jpg")} />

```notes
because VRF is a random function, we can use the Q value each round as a v(t)
"suitably random value that becoems known at time T"
```

---
export default Layout

Now we have:

- randomly selected leader
- randomly selected committee members

---
export default Layout

# Player Replaceability

Players reveal their lottery results in the same message which sends their decision

*because advesary can't prevent message from arriving, the vote will eventually be counted*

```notes
Repave
The player can effectively die because it has done its job
Committee members never reveal information about future committees
```

---
export default Layout

# `BA*`

- not the first byzantine agreement protocol
- with sortition, it is the first Player Replaceable one
- roughly, comprises 3 components each round:

---
export default Layout

### Block proposal: 1 step
### Graded Consensus: 2 steps
### Byzantine Bit Agreement: 3m steps

```notes
m is a parameter that can increase risk of false "empty" blocks in exchange for worst-case closing time
```

# Applying Byzantine Agreement

- A leader and committee are randomly elected
- <div/>leader calculates and signs a block <TeX formula={'B_r=(PAY,STATUS,H(B_{r-1}, Q_r)'}/>
- committee safely certify that `H(B)` is valid via `BA*`

```notes
it is easy to see how this contrasts with POW
```

---
export default Layout

# How does this scale?

[ 500K ] players in simulation

[ 4K ] committee members

[ 1 ] leader confirmed & block cleared

```notes
these are tested results
note that Bitcoin only has 300000 active users by some estimates
```

---
export default Layout

# One last issue...

remember player replaceability?

---
export default Layout

What if adversary corrupts the leader & committee immediately when they reveal themselves, then ze forces them to send a second message of hir choosing that will arrive before their legitimate messages?

Ze can double spend!

---
export default Layout

we are saved by Ephemeral Signing Keys:

each player uses a special key for each step, which they destroy after signing but before propagating step messages.

this is tedious and inconvenient, and thus an active area of research for me.

---
export default Layout

That's all really hard to summarize...

```notes
in fact, i think it's in the nature of cryptosystems that it's hard to summarize
but let's give it a shot
```

---
export default Layout

But let's try!

- transactions clear fast
- it is player replaceable
- scales credibly to global usage
- resists Sybil attacks*
- but still works in unpermissioned environments**
- the earth may yet survive

so you can have Mars, mr musk
but i promised you a Big Flaw
